# Solar Magic
  A tool used for the modification of level files for 
  the game Soap Man's World.

### Playing Soap Man's World
Download `test game` and `Soap Mans World.jar`. Open the command line, and type the following:

`java -jar /path/to/Soap\ Mans\ World.jar /path/to/test\ game`

This will launch a new window that should briefly display "Bathroom Co. Presents"

>Notice: Java 1.8 or later must be installed.

>Notice: The console will say "The file cannot be loaded." This issue will be adressed, but for now can be ignored.
#### Controlling the game

### Compiling Notes
This project is reccomended to be compiled with JavaSE-1.8, however JavaSE-1.6 was tested to be fully functional. `solarMagic` and `assets` are
both packages that are to be put inside of a source folder.
